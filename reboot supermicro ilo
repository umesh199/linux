Step 1: Install Required Libraries
We will need the following libraries:

pandas to read the Excel file.
openpyxl to work with .xlsx files (if your Excel sheet is in .xlsx format).
ipmitool should be installed on your machine.
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas openpyxl
Step 2: Create the Python Script


import subprocess
import pandas as pd

# Credentials for IPMI/BMC
username = "<bmc-username>"    # Replace with your IPMI username
password = "<bmc-password>"    # Replace with your IPMI password

# Function to reboot the server using IPMI
def reboot_supermicro_server(bmc_host):
    try:
        # The command to reboot the server using ipmitool
        ipmi_cmd = [
            "ipmitool", "-I", "lanplus", "-H", bmc_host, "-U", username, "-P", password, "chassis", "power", "cycle"
        ]

        # Execute the command using subprocess
        result = subprocess.run(ipmi_cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

        # Check the output for success or errors
        if result.returncode == 0:
            print(f"Server with IP {bmc_host} reboot command successful.")
            print("Output:", result.stdout.decode())
        else:
            print(f"Failed to reboot server with IP {bmc_host}.")
            print("Error:", result.stderr.decode())

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred with server {bmc_host}: {e}")

# Function to read IP addresses from Excel and reboot all servers
def reboot_multiple_servers_from_excel(file_path):
    try:
        # Read the Excel file using pandas
        df = pd.read_excel(file_path)

        # Assuming the IP addresses are in a column named 'IP'
        for index, row in df.iterrows():
            bmc_ip = row['IP']
            print(f"Rebooting server with IP: {bmc_ip}")
            reboot_supermicro_server(bmc_ip)
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to read Excel file or process the IPs: {e}")

# File path to the Excel sheet
excel_file_path = "<path-to-your-excel-file>"  # Replace with the path to your Excel file

# Call the function to read IPs from Excel and reboot all servers
reboot_multiple_servers_from_excel(excel_file_path)
