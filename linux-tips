If you want to remove /var/lib/awx/projects/eu/ (including the trailing slash) throughout the file in Vim, use this command:
:%s#/var/lib/awx/projects/eu/##g
% â†’ Apply to the entire file.
s#...#...#g â†’ Substitute globally in each line.
# â†’ Used as a delimiter to avoid escaping /.
/var/lib/awx/projects/eu/ â†’ The exact string to remove.
## â†’ Replaces it with an empty string (removes it).
g â†’ Replaces all occurrences on each line.
For confirmation before replacing each match:

ruby
Copy
Edit
:%s#/var/lib/awx/projects/eu/##gc
Press:

y to confirm replacement.
n to skip.
a to replace all occurrences.
Let me know if you need further refinements! ðŸš€
